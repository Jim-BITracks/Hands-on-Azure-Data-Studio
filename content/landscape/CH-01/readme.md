## Open Source, Cross-Platform, Multi-Database

I’ve had many strange looks after mentioning “Open Source” and “Microsoft” within the same sentence. Even from people who you might not think are all that tech savvy. This speaks volumns to not just Microsoft's history and reputation, but is embodied in their unavoidable and virtually incomprehensible licensing agreements. And yet, if you are looking for a common theme in the pages to follow, “Open Source” is exactly what you will find. And that is only the beginning when it comes to Azure Data Studio (ADS), which offers both Cross-Platform and Multi-Database capabilities. This is not the Microsoft from the years of Steve Ballmer, who once referred to the free software Linux kernel as "communism". (Full disclosure: Mr. Ballmer does have a new and fresh perspective on this topic today).
