# Chapter 1 - Open Source, Cross-Platform, Multi-Database
I have had many strange looks after mentioning “Open Source” and “Microsoft” within the same sentence. Even people not overly tech savvy can elicit a similar response, which speaks volumes to Microsoft's history and reputation. This is also reflected in their non-negotiable, and generally incomprehensible licensing agreements. And yet, if you are looking for a common theme in the pages to follow, “Open Source” is exactly what you will find in this Microsoft product. 

Even better, this is only the beginning when it comes to Azure Data Studio (ADS), which includes both Cross-Platform and Multi-Database capabilities. This is clearly not the Microsoft from earlier years, including the era of Steve Ballmer who once referred to the free software Linux kernel as ‘communism’[^1]. (Full disclosure: Mr. Ballmer does have a new and fresh perspective on the “open source” topic today).

## What “Open Source” means for this new breed of Microsoft Software
Azure Data Studio provides for a happy convergence of ‘free’, ‘powerful’, and ‘open source’. In this world, ‘free’ and ‘powerful’ can often be a winning combination, as demonstrated with popular desktop products such as Notepad++ and web-based applications like Gmail. Adding ‘open source’ to a product is even a greater ‘win’ and has to potential to shift an entire software market.

A card more commonly played by a market newcomer, Microsoft’s ‘open source’ strategy is a surprising and encouraging development. After all, creative software developers worldwide desire to make their mark, which is exponentially more difficult in a strategically ‘closed’ environment, clouded with draconian licensing restrictions. By going ‘open source’, Microsoft has essentially sided with individuals, and smaller development shops, providing a path for first class extensions integrated into their widely available products.

Interestingly, the world of open source is a two-way street. Not only do Developers gain a new avenue for productive and creative expression, but Microsoft, now the world’s top open source contributor , is rewarded by many new, as well as ‘off payroll’ programmers. Independent developers over the world can now contribute to Microsoft’s open source products directly on GitHub. This places their code just one “pull request” away from potentially improving core Microsoft products.

### A perspective Open Source
The open source concept is a bit like receiving a free video camera along with step by step instructions on how it was built. You can not only use the camera to make the next YouTube sensation, but you could alter the camera to add a custom telephoto lens, extended battery, or motion detector. While functional changes are admittedly much more difficult than simply using the camera, the ‘potential’ is there. This engineering transparency adds a layer of technical scrutiny to the manufacturer, but would most likely lead to broader, not to mention more ‘cost competitive’ aftermarket products.

This is the new world of Microsoft open source. Even though you may never want, need, or have time to plow through the ADS “source code”, the mere fact that you can is critically important for the product and its forward potential.

Microsoft’s licensing for Azure Data Studio is also a departure from the past, consisting of just two ‘readable’ paragraphs. The text has very liberal license terms for ADS  , granting even sublicensing rights when you are using ADS with your affiliates and/or vendors, while they are performing work on your behalf.
